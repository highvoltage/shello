shello
======

### What's this?

shello is short for "shell logo".

It helps you configure a shell logo for your bash shell
so that you don't forget on which machine you're working on.

All you need to do is download shello.sh, do a "chmod +x shello.sh"
and run "./shello.sh" and complete the instructions it provides.

Hmm, what else can I say... patches welcome?
